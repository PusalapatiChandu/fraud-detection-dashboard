# 🏆 FraudWatch AI - Hackathon Pitch

## Problem Statement
> India's government benefit schemes lose **₹10,000+ crores annually** to fraud and duplicate claims. Current detection is slow, manual, and lacks transparency.

## Solution: FraudWatch AI
**Real-time fraud detection + Explainable AI for transparent governance**

### Key Innovation: Hybrid AI Approach
- **Rules** (60%): Domain knowledge catches known patterns
  - Unusually high amounts
  - Duplicate beneficiary IDs  
  - Scheme-specific anomalies
  
- **Machine Learning** (40%): Isolation Forest catches unknown fraud
  - Unexpected transaction patterns
  - Contextual anomalies

### Why This Wins
✅ **Transparent**: Shows WHY each transaction is suspicious
✅ **Fast**: Real-time detection (no human review delays)
✅ **Scalable**: Works across all government schemes
✅ **Trustworthy**: Hybrid approach (rules prove logic, ML catches unknowns)

## Features Demonstrated
1. **Live Fraud Detection** - Upload CSV, get instant results
2. **Risk Scoring** - 0-100 scale with color badges (🟢 🟡 🔴)
3. **Explainability** - Click to see WHY each transaction is fraud
4. **Duplicate Detection** - Identify same person claiming multiple benefits
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Risk trends by region, scheme, time

## Impact Metrics
- **Precision**: Catches real fraud, low false positives
- **Transparency**: Every alert has clear, auditable reasons
- **Policy Ready**: Outputs can directly inform policy decisions
- **Social Impact**: Protects vulnerable populations from fraud, ensures fair distribution

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Isolation Forest)
- Streamlit (fast, beautiful UI with zero deployment headache)
- No databases needed (pure ML + rules)

## Call to Action
Deploy FraudWatch AI as a **government-wide platform** to:
1. Save ₹10,000+ crores annually
2. Improve public trust through transparency
3. Enable data-driven policy decisions
4. Protect vulnerable beneficiaries
